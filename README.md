A production-ready template for conducting systematic, comprehensive research using Claude Code following the [Deep Research Model](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Deep-Research-Model).

## What is This?

This template provides a complete, structured workflow for using Claude Code as a deep research assistant. Instead of ad-hoc conversations, this model:

- **Systematizes research** with clear phases and workflows
- **Documents everything** in organized directories
- **Generates reusable outputs** in multiple formats
- **Builds on previous work** through structured context
- **Scales from quick investigations to comprehensive studies**

## Quick Start

### 1. Use This Template

Click "Use this template" on GitHub or clone locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Deep-Research-Template.git my-research-project
cd my-research-project
```

### 2. Initialize Your Research

Open the repository in Claude Code and run:

```bash
/initiate-research
```

Claude will interview you about your research needs and set up your project.

### 3. Start Researching

Follow Claude's guidance through the research workflow:
- Context gathering
- Prompt planning
- Research execution
- Output synthesis

## How It Works

### Research Workflow

1. **Context Gathering** - Provide background, objectives, and constraints
2. **Prompt Planning** - Claude generates research questions systematically
3. **Research Execution** - Execute prompts, document findings, generate follow-ups
4. **Output Synthesis** - Aggregate findings into comprehensive reports
5. **Iteration** - Build on previous research in subsequent sessions

### Specialized Agents

The template includes three specialized agents:

- **Research Coordinator** - Orchestrates the overall workflow
- **Prompt Generator** - Creates effective research questions
- **Research Synthesizer** - Aggregates findings into reports

## Key Features

### Systematic Research
- Structured phases from exploration to synthesis
- Clear progression through research depth
- Built-in quality checkpoints

### Comprehensive Documentation
- All findings automatically documented
- Research log tracks progress
- Conversation histories archived

### Multiple Output Formats
- Markdown reports
- PDF documents
- TTS-safe text
- SSML for voice synthesis

### Reusable Context
- Build on previous research sessions
- Archive and reference past work
- Continuous knowledge accumulation

## Slash Commands

- `/initiate-research` - Start a new deep research project

Add your own custom commands in `.claude/commands/`

## Use Cases

This template works for:

- **Academic Research** - Literature reviews, topic exploration
- **Market Research** - Industry analysis, competitive intelligence
- **Technical Investigation** - Technology evaluation, architecture research
- **Strategic Planning** - Trend analysis, scenario planning
- **Content Creation** - Research for articles, presentations, reports
- **Learning** - Deep dives into new subjects

## Configuration

### CLAUDE.md

The `CLAUDE.md` file contains instructions for Claude on how to operate in this repository. Customize it for your specific needs.

### Custom Slash Commands

Create new slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:

```bash
.claude/commands/my-command.md
```

### Custom Agents

Define specialized agents in `.claude/agents/`:

```bash
.claude/agents/my-agent.md
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with /initiate-research** - Let Claude set up your project properly
2. **Provide rich context** - The more context, the better the research
3. **Review and refine** - Check Claude's research plan before execution
4. **Synthesize regularly** - Don't wait until the end to aggregate
5. **Archive conversations** - Save conversation histories for future reference

## Tips for Deep Research

- **Be specific about objectives** - Clear goals lead to focused research
- **Iterate on prompts** - Refine research questions based on findings
- **Use the scratchpad** - Experiment without cluttering main outputs
- **Document methodology** - Note how you arrived at conclusions
- **Build incrementally** - Research in sessions, build on previous work

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Clone template
git clone <template-url> my-research

# 2. Open in Claude Code
cd my-research
claude-code .

# 3. Initialize research
/initiate-research

# 4. Provide context when prompted
# - Research topic
# - Objectives
# - Scope and depth
# - Output requirements

# 5. Review generated research plan
# - Approve or refine

# 6. Let Claude execute research
# - Findings documented automatically
# - Follow-up prompts generated
# - Progress tracked

# 7. Generate synthesis
# - Request aggregated report
# - Multiple formats created

# 8. Continue or conclude
# - Archive session
# - Plan next session
# - Or finalize deliverables
```
