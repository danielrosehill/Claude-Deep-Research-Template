# Prompts Directory

Organize your research prompts by workflow stage.

## Subdirectories

### `drafting/`
Store draft prompts and prompt experiments here. This is your workspace for refining prompts before queuing them.

**Use for:**
- Initial prompt ideas
- Prompt variations
- Testing different approaches
- Refining prompt language

### `queue/`
Place prompts ready to be executed in the next research session.

**Use for:**
- Finalized prompts awaiting execution
- Sequenced research questions
- Prioritized prompt list

### `run/initial/`
Store the initial prompts that start a new research thread or topic.

**Use for:**
- First prompts in a research session
- Exploratory questions
- Broad research directions
- Initial context-setting prompts

### `run/subsequent/`
Store follow-up prompts that build on previous research.

**Use for:**
- Deepening questions
- Clarifications
- Refinement prompts
- Synthesis requests

## Workflow

1. Draft prompts in `drafting/`
2. Move finalized prompts to `queue/`
3. Execute initial prompts from `run/initial/`
4. Continue with subsequent prompts from `run/subsequent/`
5. Archive completed prompts with dates

## Naming Convention

Consider using descriptive names with dates:
- `2025-11-02-topic-exploration.md`
- `follow-up-question-1.md`
- `synthesis-request.md`

## Prompt Template

Each prompt file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Prompt Title]

## Context
[Relevant background from previous research]

## Primary Question
[Main research question]

## Sub-questions
- [Supporting question 1]
- [Supporting question 2]

## Expected Output
[What kind of answer is needed]

## Sources to Consider
[Suggested source types]

## Connection to Research Goals
[How this advances the overall research]
```
