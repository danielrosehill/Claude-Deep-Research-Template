## Session Workflow

### Starting a Research Session

1. **Review Context**
   - Read `context/from-human/project-context.md`
   - Check research log: `notes/research-log.md`
   - Review queued prompts: `prompts/queue/`

2. **Set Session Objectives**
   - Define what to accomplish in this session
   - Select prompts to execute
   - Estimate session scope

3. **Prepare Environment**
   - Create dated session folder if needed
   - Initialize session notes
   - Prepare output directories

### During Research Session

1. **Execute Research**
   - Process prompts systematically
   - Document findings in real-time
   - Generate follow-up questions
   - Maintain research flow

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Track against session objectives
   - Note interesting tangents
   - Flag blocking issues
   - Adjust course as needed

3. **Maintain Documentation**
   - Save outputs to `outputs/individual/`
   - Update research log continuously
   - Archive conversation context
   - Generate subsequent prompts

### Ending a Research Session

1. **Session Summary**
   - Summarize findings from session
   - List key insights discovered
   - Document outstanding questions
   - Note unexpected directions

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Complete research log entry
   - Archive conversation in `context/from-history/`
   - Update project context if needed
   - Clean up scratchpad

3. **Plan Next Session**
   - Generate prompts for next session
   - Prioritize remaining research areas
   - Identify synthesis opportunities
   - Set next session objectives

4. **Deliverables Check**
   - Verify outputs are properly saved
   - Check documentation completeness
   - Ensure proper file organization
   - Validate naming conventions

## Research Phase Management

### Phase 1: Exploration
- Execute broad, exploratory prompts
- Map the research landscape
- Identify key concepts and areas
- Generate comprehensive follow-up questions

### Phase 2: Deep Dive
- Execute focused, detailed prompts
- Investigate specific aspects thoroughly
- Gather comprehensive evidence
- Document findings with citations

### Phase 3: Synthesis
- Review all individual findings
- Identify patterns and themes
- Create aggregated reports
- Generate multiple output formats

### Phase 4: Validation
- Verify findings against sources
- Check for gaps or inconsistencies
- Validate conclusions
- Refine final outputs

## Decision Points

**When to synthesize:**
- Accumulated 5+ individual research outputs
- Completed a logical research phase
- User requests interim report
- Natural break point in research

**When to go deeper:**
- Critical knowledge gaps identified
- Conflicting information needs resolution
- User interest in specific area
- Foundation for further research needed

**When to broaden:**
- Current thread exhausted
- Need wider context
- Multiple perspectives needed
- Connecting to related areas

**When to conclude:**
- Research objectives met
- Diminishing returns on new research
- User satisfied with coverage
- Time/resource constraints

## Quality Checklist

Before ending any session, verify:

- [ ] All research outputs saved appropriately
- [ ] Research log updated with session details
- [ ] Follow-up prompts generated
- [ ] Findings properly documented
- [ ] Sources cited correctly
- [ ] Conversation context archived
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined
- [ ] File organization maintained

## Communication with User

### Regular Updates
Provide periodic updates on:
- Research progress
- Key findings so far
- Interesting discoveries
- Upcoming research directions

### Decision Points
Consult user on:
- Major direction changes
- Depth vs. breadth tradeoffs
- Synthesis timing
- Output format preferences

### Session Boundaries
Clearly mark:
- Session starts and objectives
- Session summaries and achievements
- Handoff points between sessions
